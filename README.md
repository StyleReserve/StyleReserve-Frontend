## :pushpin: Abstract
Styler is a very familiar appliance to modern people. You can put a smelly coat or jacket in your office after lunch. However, if the styler is already being used by other employees unexpectedly, it will be very difficult. Also, modern people have a lot of clothes and spend a lot of time thinking about what to wear tomorrow. There are even cases where my family wears the clothes that I will wear tomorrow first.
Our team aimed at LG's styler so that we could reserve clothes for the styler in advance, and help people decide what to wear later. Our application not only provides users with the ability to schedule when to use the styler, but also allows other members to participate in the reservation of LG styler during the time someone has reserved Therefore, it helps the LG styler not to waste maximum clothing capacity and helps maintain a lifestyle of users. And it maximizes user convenience by preventing other family members from wearing your clothes first.

## :pushpin: Proposal
Styler is very familiar to modern people. This is because it is a home appliance that they can easily access even in the office. But if the styler is already in use when you have to eat smelly food and remove the smell of your clothes, you will feel very nervous. This is what happens because there is no communication between colleagues when to use the styler.

Modern people think about what to wear tomorrow. It would be very embarrassing if the brothers or sisters who live with wore imperatively necessary clothes early in the morning and went out. In this case, likewise, this incident occurs because they cannot communicate with each other what to wear the next day.

But what if the company could reserve the time to use Styler in advance? And what if we also had electronic devices to help us share what we're going to wear the next day? In fact, many people recognize the need and usefulness of sharing schedules with each other, and install and use schedule-sharing applications such as To-do-mate app.
  
Our team came up with 'Style Reserve' using LG Styler. "Style Reserve" is an app that allows people to communicate and confirm reservations so that they can use the styler at the time they want at work. It is also an app that displays what clothes to wear on the calendar and communicates with each other so that they do not overlap. In this paper, we look at the main customer base of 'Style Reserve' and the current market status. Based on this, I will explain the main role of 'Style Reserve'.

  
## :pushpin: Target Users
We looked at the needs of the major customer base of 'LG Styler', which is successful in business. We focused on three things below. 1) The fact that multiple members can use the Styler in the office at the same time 2) The Styler can be used at any time you want without having to line up in front of the Styler in the office, 3) The fact that there are people at home who share clothes with their family members. So we named the "StyleReserve" in consideration of end-user in that it is a service to provide to those who need to make reservations at Style. The end-user may be an independent at office or an independent at home.
  
## :pushpin: Goal

a. It presents an idea using Styler, an LG home appliance used to manage clothes neatly. Now most offices have Styler. We would like to propose a 'StyleReserve' that allows members of the office to use Styler at any time of their choice.

b. In order to minimize the vacancy of hangers when booking Styler, we would like to propose a function that allows those who use the same course to participate in the reservation together.

c. In the case of using Styler in the family unit, we want to prevent overlapping schedules for family members to wear clothes. It provides a UI that can manage and grasp data such as the date to wear clothes through 'StyleReserve'.
  
d. "StyleReserve" will provide a service that informs you of the schedule related to clothes by sending a push notification that recommends booking a styler in advance by informing you of the clothes you will wear the next day in advance. // 푸시 알림 기능 있을 경우에만 포함할 내용

e. When adding clothes to StyleReserve, it is possible to add them automatically without having to enter all the information related to clothes directly. For products registered with MUSINSA, convenience is provided by automatically registering photos and information of the clothes.//무신사 모듈 있을 경우에만 포함할 내용
